        <p class="intro-text">I graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering in 2019 from the University of Nottingham. My first encounter with coding was 
            during my dissertation where I had to use C# to develop a simple application. Since then I have studied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            and have applied what I have learned in personal projects. Some of my projects include an Instagram bot created using Puppeteer.js as well as a website with a headless
            content management system. My current goal is to become proficient in React.</p>
